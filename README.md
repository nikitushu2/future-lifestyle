# future-lifestyle
[Building AI course project]
AI project for estimating the most appropriate lifestyle for the future


## Summary

What is the best lifestyle to lead to both survive under harsh conditions in a short period of time and thrive with unlimited resources for infinity for both an individual and the humanity? AI will help to choose and facilitate the transition from your current way of living.


## Background

This project solves the fundamental problem of living, answering the question of how to live, and the immediate demand of surviving, helping to react to the black swans of the physical realm. In terms of practicality and current time, it also allows you to prepare and fit into the upcoming 4th and 5th industrial revolutions as well as the post-covid world.


## How is it used?

The artificial intelligence will be using supervised learning to distinct actions between those that contribute to the continuity of the society and those that do not. Also, the classification techniques will sort the previously sorted actions based on new criteria, thus making the selection of actions as narrow as possible.

The approximate representation of layer-criteria that actions will go through:
1. Actions that contribute to the continuity of an individual.
2. Actions that contribute to the continuity of the society.
3. Actions that contribute to both 1. and 2.
4. Actions that are the best for the short period of time from 3.
5. Actions that are the best for the infinity from 3.
6. Actions that contribute to both short and long time periods from 5.

The dataset of all possible actions under 0. may come from many sources. The main criteria is continuity. Example: smoking - does not contribute to the longevity, so it gets excluded, unlike, for example, eating non-junk food. Though smoking might provide continuity in a short period of time, during stressfull days, thus the complexity of the data choice arises.

The final result could be an interactive web game-like interface that would take the current lifestyle of a person as an input and returning a plan for transitioning it to the best way of living. The main idea behind the best way of living is continuity of a person, hence also the society.


## Data sources and AI methods
The data gets collected from the historic cases and current ways of living. The potential pool of data is the whole web, books, archives, etc. To narrow the search, the examples of successful people, countries, etc. may apply.

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?
The project does not answer questions regarding living other than of that of how to prolong the living. One of the main limitations of the project is the objective estimation of contribution of a particular action to the continuity of life. There should be no ethical considerations as all the ways of living contributing to the continuity of life automatically excludes those that do not contribute to life such as addictions or suicides.

## What next?

To grow the project the author needs to have a greater necessity which would result into a passion to continue with the idea other than to just present his own idea as a part of the task from the Elements of AI: part 2 course.
